This repository demonstrates use of IATA SSIM Parsing Writing Library [Gna.Iata](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gna.Iata) in regular JavaScript website (as wasm module).

Instead of rewriting everything for the web, developers can write the logic once in C# and turn it into code that runs smoothly in any modern browser.
