This website shows how the same C# code (Gna.Iata library) can be used in regular JavaScript websites (wasm modules). Instead of rewriting everything for the web, developers can write the logic once in C# and turn it into code that runs smoothly in any browser. Itâ€™s a smart way to save time, reduce complexity, and keep everything working consistently across different platforms.
